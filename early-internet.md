## ARPANET and the Origins of the Internet

### Creation of ARPANET
- **ARPANET** was established by the US government's **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)** during the Cold War era.
- The goal was to create a resilient communication system that could survive potential disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions.

### Purpose of ARPANET
- Designed to enable:
  - Reliable communication between geographically distributed research facilities.
  - Efficient file sharing and resource access among researchers.

### Role of TCP/IP Protocols
- **TCP/IP protocols** were fundamental to ARPANET's operation, standardizing the transmission of data across different systems.
- These protocols laid the groundwork for modern internet communication.

## Evolution of the Internet

### Transition to the World Wide Web
- As ARPANET expanded, the need arose for a more intuitive way to access and share information.
- This led to the development of the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, which revolutionized how users interacted with online content.

### Contribution of Tim Berners-Lee
- Tim Berners-Lee played a pivotal role in the creation of the World Wide Web.
- Key achievements include:
  - Developing the first website, which demonstrated the concept of linking documents through **hyperlinks**.
  - Establishing the foundation for web browsers and HTML, which became essential tools for navigating the web.

### Early Challenges and the Rise of Search Engines
- In the early days of the web, there was no search engine, making it difficult for users to locate information.
- This gap spurred the creation of search engines like **Yahoo**, which significantly improved the accessibility and usability of the internet.

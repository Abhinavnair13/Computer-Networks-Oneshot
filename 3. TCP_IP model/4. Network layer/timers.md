# Timers in Networking (With Simple Real-World Examples)

## What are Timers?
In networking, **timers** are used to track events, retransmit lost data, and manage connections. They help ensure smooth communication by handling delays and errors.

## Types of Timers (With Real-World Examples)

### 1. **Retransmission Timer** – "Waiting for a reply"
- **Use case**: If a data packet is sent but no acknowledgment (ACK) is received within a certain time, the sender **resends** the data.
- **Example**:
  - You send a message on WhatsApp. If your friend **doesn’t reply in 5 minutes**, you **send a follow-up message** to check if they got it.

### 2. **Persistence Timer** – "Checking if the other side is still active"
- **Use case**: Prevents a situation where the receiver is unable to send acknowledgments due to network congestion. The sender periodically **checks if the receiver is still there**.
- **Example**:
  - You text your friend, but they haven’t responded. Instead of spamming messages, you **send a polite ‘Are you there?’ after some time**.

### 3. **Keepalive Timer** – "Ping to check if someone is online"
- **Use case**: Used to check if a connection is still active. If no response is received, the connection is closed.
- **Example**:
  - A video call app sends **small signals every few seconds** to check if the other person is still connected. If no response, the call ends.
